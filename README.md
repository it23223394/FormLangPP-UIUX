# FormLang++ – UI/UX Prototype

This project is part of the Programming Principles (PP) assignment at SLIIT.  
It showcases the **UI/UX design and prototype** for a language named **FormLang++**, a form-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) intended to validate and generate interactive forms.


---

## 🎯 Objective

- Design an intuitive UI/UX prototype to demonstrate how FormLang++ works.
- Validate `.form` files and generate corresponding HTML output.
- Showcase custom validations, required fields, and minimal form structures.

---

## 🧪 Features

- ✔️ Form parsing and validation
- ✔️ Sample `.form` files with corresponding HTML output
- ✔️ Prototype grammar using `lex.l` and `yacc.y`
- ✔️ Sample UI previews
- ✔️ Documentation PDF included
